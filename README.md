# Wallpaper Selector

A modern iOS wallpaper browsing and selection app built with SwiftUI, featuring smooth animations and professional UI design.

## What does this project do?

**Wallpaper Selector** is an elegant iOS application that provides users with an intuitive way to browse and select wallpapers:

- **Immersive Browsing**: Full-screen wallpaper viewing with edge-to-edge display
- **Interactive Selection**: Long-press or swipe gestures to enter selection mode
- **Smooth Transitions**: Wallpapers scale down with 36px rounded corners during selection
- **Horizontal Scrolling**: Seamless navigation between multiple wallpaper options
- **Professional Interface**: Dual toolbar system with context-aware visibility
- **Custom Branding**: Integrated user avatar and logo assets

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies
- **SwiftUI** - Modern declarative UI framework for iOS
- **Swift** - Primary programming language
- **Xcode** - Development environment and project management

### UI/UX Features
- **Material Design** - Ultra-thin material backgrounds for depth
- **Core Animation** - Spring animations for smooth transitions
- **Custom Components** - Modular view architecture for maintainability
- **Asset Management** - Integrated custom logos and user avatars
- **Gesture Recognition** - Long press and swipe gesture handling

### Animation System
- **Scale Transformations** - Dynamic wallpaper scaling (1.0x ‚Üî 0.75x)
- **Y-Translation** - Toolbar slide animations for enhanced UX
- **Opacity Transitions** - Smooth fade effects between UI states
- **Spring Physics** - Natural, responsive animation curves

## What makes it special?

### üé® **Professional Design**
- Inspired by modern apps like Perplexity Pro
- Clean, minimal interface with no visual clutter
- Custom asset integration for personalized branding

### üèóÔ∏è **Advanced Architecture**
- **Modular Component System**: Broke complex views into manageable sub-components to solve Swift compiler limitations
- **Dual Toolbar Pattern**: Context-aware toolbars that appear/disappear based on user state
- **Clean Separation**: Main toolbar for browsing, selection toolbar for choosing wallpapers

### ‚ö° **Smooth Performance**
- **Optimized Rendering**: Solved layout complexity issues with strategic component separation
- **Synchronized Animations**: All UI elements animate in perfect harmony
- **Gesture-Driven UX**: Intuitive interactions that feel natural and responsive

### üîß **Technical Excellence**
